🤖 ***A Twitter bot that will help you save tweets and threads to your Todoist account***

## About the project

🚀 This bot is deployed in [Qoddi](https://qoddi.com/) and uses a MongoDB database stored in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/es/atlas/database)

🔏 All the user's data is encrypted before being saved to the DB using hashing algorithms and is never shared with third parts.

## Contributing
